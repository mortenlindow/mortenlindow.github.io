Since February 2025 I am the leader of the [Center for Pharmaceutical Data Science Education](https://cpdse.dk) and professor at the [Deparment for Drug Design and Pharmacology at the University of Copenhagen](http://drug.ku.dk). Read one of my pieces on the need for data science integration in pharma [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/days-bridging-gone-now-full-integration-morten-lindow-xlczf/?trackingId=e8iHNR5eRpGgi6l2gO9B8g%3D%3D).

This website is a slight adaptation of **the job application** that landed me this fantastic job. It is only sporadically updated. Please follow me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mlindow) and the [CPDSE website](https://cpdse.dk) for news and updates.

Briefly about me:

-   17 yrs experience and track record of turning ideas into drug candidates. Leading and supporting roles in \>40 oligonucleotide drug discovery projects: 5 reached clinical stages, 2 in phase 2, 2 programs with novel conjugate targeting moeities reaching clinical development

-   One of the pioneers behind computational design of oligonucleotide drugs. Structure-activity-relationships, specificity, kinetic models and practical implementation in drug discovery. See @sec-research below.

-   Tireless and often successful proponent of integration between data science and drug discovery: From data-geeks to drivers of RNA-therapy projects in Santaris and RICC, digital strategy for Roche pRED, bioinformatics integration into Research in Lundbeck and organizational design for data and analytics in Roche pRED, RNAHub as a fully integrated cross-functional unit in Roche and now Center for Pharmaceutical Data Science Education. See @sec-data-science below.

-   Experience and passion for leading and evolving progressive and human centered ways of working and organizing together in scientific enterprises: project maturity and innovation leadership in RICC, ReimagineOurContribution in Roche, RNAHub in Roche and CPDSE's way of working. See @sec-org-dev-leadership below.

-   Entrepreneurial ecosystem and community creator: Nordic Nucleic Acid Based Medicine Network (founder and driver), Danish RNA Society (co-founder and former board member), Beers Data and Drugs, Biogeeks, various industry-academia advisory boards, leading roles in 4 public-private founded partnerships, various non-professional NGOs. See @sec-ecosystems-communities below.

# Research: Oligonucleotide design and discovery {#sec-research}

-   Led and built the discipline of oligonucleotide drug design in Santaris Pharma and Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (2008-2016, group leader).
-   Essential scientific software tool for oligo discovery:
    -   Architect and code-base for TargetSurveyor (internal to Santaris and Roche), a software suite that systematically enumerates and computationally assess all possible target sites and viable chemical modifications for a possible drug target.
    -   Architect for miRMaid, a repository for miRNA information ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20074352/)), Pythia, a system to register, manage and support all information pertaining to physical Oligonucleotides (internal to Santaris and Roche)
-   Oversight and advise on global Roche systems supporting RNA Therapeutics.
    -   Thought-leader on principles and practices of managing the sequence specificity of oligonucleotides. Numerous talks and publications: [Nat.Biotech](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23051805/), [NAR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28426096/), [NAR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26220183/), [NAR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29126318/), [NAR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29790953/)
-   Led first (and most cited) application of machine learning to predict in vivo safety of oligonucleotides (hepatotox-predictor, [NAR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23952551/)). Coached and catalysed internal Roche teams building and deploying proprietary oligo models.
-   Led development of kinetic model that explains relationships between affinity, potency, turn-over and efficacy of oligos. Insights and model key to understand and optimise oligonucleotides drug candidates. [Mol.Ther.Nuc.Acids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549300/)

# Data science, bioinformatics and their integration into biology and chemistry {#sec-data-science}

-   Promoted and coached OligoLoop (2022-2024, sponsor, RNAHub) - a setup and team aiming for 2-week cycles from design of oligos, synthesis in small scale, screening in cells with RNASeq and learning from the data. Then iterate.

-   Embedding of 3 data engineers, 3 data scientists and 3 bioinformaticians full-time into the cross-functional RNAHub with biologists and chemists (2022-2024, RNAHub lead). Spreading and providing data literacy and higher quality experiments and analysis.  ASFAIK, this is so far the highest level of overall data literacy in any Roche end-to-end discovery team.

-   Roche Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED) Digital Strategy (2017, member). Strategy team member for global Roche Strategy, spanning from ML for qSAR, FAIR-data, omics, stratification, companion-diagnostics and more. Spawning numerous very costly workstreams. Far too big and too siloed in their own digital world, so my impact was unfortunately minimal.

-   Design team for Data and Analytics organization in pRED (2021, member). Org-design led to a ‘hub and spoke’ org-model, where ‘spokes’ should be embedded with the chemists and biologists. Good direction, but not yet fully implemented.

-   Expanded and shifted bioinformatics and data science, from a heavy clinical development anchoring into early research at Lundbeck (2018-2020, director). Formed and led target decision support teamand new modalities assessment team.

-   Bioinformatics group in Santaris (2008-2014, director): shift bioinformaticians from tool-builders and service providers to (co-) leaders of discovery projects.

# Leadership: Design and co-leading progressive scientific organizations {#sec-org-dev-leadership}

-   Project Excellence and Innovation Office at Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (2014-2018, director). Raising organizational project and innovation maturity (training, discipline, rhythms and rituals)

-   ReimagineOurContribution (2020-21, lead): a progressive project that changed performance management practices for a Roche business unit of 750 people: From extrinsic motivation and judgments (bonus, ratings) to intrinsic motivation (autonomy, purpose, mastery and belonging). Motto: from me to we.

Corporate strategy and reorganizations:

-   RNA Therapeutics Research Strategy in Roche (2016, supportive lead).

-   RNA Molecule Strategy and Reorg in Roche (2018, supportive lead). Focus on core competences in Denmark

-   RNA Consolidation Strategy and Reorg (2022, supportive lead). Led to the closure of the Danish Roche site and consolidation of all activities in Basel. I led the transfer and rebuilding from Copenhagen to Basel in the RNAHub.

-   RNAHub (2022-2024, lead), pioneering way of working across specialities never tried in Roche before. [Promo site of our RNAHub approach](https://www.roche.com/stories/best-of-both-worlds)

# Ecosystem and community {#sec-ecosystems-communities}

-   Nordic Nucleic Acid Based Medicine Industry Network (2020-, founder and main driver). Unites the growing Danish Industry ecosystem on RNA and Gene therapy. Just had our 6th and largest meeting at BII.

-   Beers data and drugs. Informal after work gatherings of pharma and tech professionals (2020-2023, co-founder). One event at Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen, 3 events at Abzu.ai.

-   Leading roles in 4 industry-academia grants from Højteknologifonden and Innovationsfonden.

-   Advisory board roles at NextProd and RNALeaders-conference

-   Employer and industry board for at Uni Copenhagen: Humanbiology education, Biomedical Institute (BMI) (2016-2022)

-   Oligonucleotide Safety Working Group (DIA), 2012-2014

-   Pro-bono advisor for several start ups at BII (2023-).

-   Lindow Bioconsult (founder and consultant, 2012-2015)

-   Biogeeks bioinformatics consultancy collective (2008-2011)
