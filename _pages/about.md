With 17 years in drug discovery, I’ve been fortunate to work with more than 40 oligonucleotide projects — and to see five reach clinical stages, two now in Phase 2. Every one of them was a reminder that progress in science is a team effort, built on curiosity, rigor, and good data collection and analysis. [Read more about my research](/research).

My passion is evolving how we work and learn together. Integrating data science into drug discovery isn’t just about technology — it’s about culture, co-leadership, and shared understanding. At Roche, I helped shape digital strategies, integrate bioinformatics into research, and build cross-functional teams like the RNAHub, connecting 50 scientists around a common purpose.

In 2025, I took on a new challenge: leading the [Centre for Pharmaceutical Data Science Education (CPDSE)](https://cpdse.dk) at the Universities of Copenhagen and Southern Denmark. Our mission is to help the next generation of scientists become fluent in both biology and data — because the medicines of tomorrow will be discovered by people who can navigate both worlds.

I care deeply about building bridges between disciplines, between academia and industry, and between experienced experts and those just starting out. Read more about my [educational offers](/education)
