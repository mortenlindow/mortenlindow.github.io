    "text": "Figure: Morten’s little leadership model, (adapted from professional agile coach certification). The middle holds core principles that I strive towards to uphold in an organisation. The outer circle has the four roles that we need to consciously shift between, the top quadrants being one-to-many situations vs one-to-one on the bottom. Right is content neutral, while left is where you lead also a content expert. The bottom are the areas to which I can apply the roles. I try to remain conscious about when I apply each role. Trainer/teacher The trainer role is applied when I need to convey learning of content that I master to groups of people that do not yet\nWhenever possible, I use a very interactive and involving type of training, which often surprises people in highly scientific parts of pharma, where the prevalent culture tends to be classical lecture or conference style. I am inspired by the very practical ideas of Bowman, Training from the BACK of the room. When I remember Bowman’s 4Cs (connect, concepts, concrete practice and conclusion) and Six Trumps, my training sessions are usually much better.\nInternal training has almost always followed a strategy of raising overall organizational and scientific maturity in order to develop each other to have more T-shaped skill sets (generalizing specialists, e.g biology AND data science or biology AND project leadership). In many instances training was procured from external suppliers."

Requirement: own students, postdocs for coding and data mining and curation. Existing network to consolidate already public data and code Building on: center resources on data and code orchestration, increment on top current work.\nOpenOligoFeat - featurization and ML for learning and mapping between structure and function for oligonucleotides. Apply to predict safety, activity and stability on public data sets. Requirement: own students, postdocs for coding and data curation. Collaboration on advanced machine learning. Building on: experience with hepatotox, acute neurotox and activity predictors, public datasets (from OpenOligoLake). Base can be quickly and independently established, then expand through Industry and tech collaborations, e.g. Roche, Novo, Silence, Abzu.ai\nOpenOligoCommunity: Activate and expand existing networks to build pre-competitive partnerships to enable and accelerate oligonucleotide drugs. Pursue national and EU funding. I have an existing network interested in this, but my current Roche anchoring makes it more difficult. A not-for-profit anchoring provides a basis for catalyzing open sharing and diverse funding to facilitate public or joint ownership models or open source in the precompetitve spaces. Requirement: outreach and ecosystem building. Some leading to joint grant applications\nOpenNABMPKPD - mechanistic systems pharmacology models for nucleic acid based medicines\nExpanding from our ASO-model with PK and into other NABMs. Compartment-models for the tissues, for crossing barriers, for entering cells, for molecular mode of action, etc. Contrary to standard PKPD models used in drug development, this system of models would be more detailed and mechanistic including cellular uptake, stability of both pharmacophore and targeting system, molecular mechanisms of action (enzymes for oligos, transcription, translation etc for AAVs). We will not be able to estimate all parameters from data, but having a model (with a simple graphical interface) will allow us to simulate the effect of changes in each step, which would lead to the following benefits: better understanding of what to optimize. What matters? What doesn’t? Are we talking about the same things? Framework to become quantitative and more precise. Simulations used for teaching. Framework to simulate and therefore better plan wetlab experiments in NABM. Planning dosing schemes for animal and human studies. Requirements: own students, collaboration on math for dynamic models if not brought by students"

Additional funding necessary and expected.\n\nDesign-build-test-learn loops. To accelerate learning about oligonucleotide drugs it is essential to have fast learning loops between molecule design, synthesis, testing and learning. In this phase this should be established either through own lab footprint or through collaborations and vendors/CROs.\nOpenTranscriptomeFoundationModel - Foundation models for the transcriptome. Given an oligonucleotide chemical structure, what are the predicted transcriptome changes? And given a desired transcriptome change (e.g. sick to healthy) what oligonucleotides will induce change? This is almost the holy grail of RNATherapy data science.\nRequirement: Development and connection to expertise on RNA-foundation models, connection to oligo perturbed transcriptome data sets (mined through OpenOligoLake or produced through collaboration). Expected technological evolution in the field, including use of RNASeq-methods (e.g DrugSeq or BRB-Seq) in early screening campaigns for oligonucleotides drugs.\nOpenDiscoveryCascadeModel\nOne can define the drug discovery business process of lead identification and optimization as a series of operations that attempts to poll the in human properties (e.g efficacy, PK and safety) of sets of molecules, which may be expanded along the way. Such operations are often called things like ‘in silico predictions’, ‘screens’, ‘assays’, ‘animal studies’ etc. Each operation carries a cost in terms of time and money; and one can broadly define an operation’s predictive validity as its ability to predict the outcome of a later, often more expensive, operation. A cascade is a set of connected operations, in series or in parallel that eventually leads to abandoning of the discovery project or entry into human trials. It is desirable to optimize a cascade that minimizes time and cost while maximising the combined predictive validity, i.e. the chance that the clinical lead molecule will be successful in humans.\nA fundamental problem in the drug discovery industry is that cascades are almost always designed by qualitative tradition, opinions and assumptions. Real discovery cascades are slow (2+ yrs) and involve many different specialists, meaning that holistic systems learning is very slow and difficult to implement. In the OpenDiscoveryCascadeModel-project we aim to create a stochastic graphical model abstraction of the discovery cascades. Such a model will allow (1) a more rational cascade design and (2) can be used as a teaching tool, e.g by turning it into a learning game with ‘engine building mechanics’ that can be used in university classes as well with project and strategy teams in the pharma drug discovery business.\nRequirements: 2 students/post-docs, connect to graphical models expertise, game and workshop design expertise; industry connections for examples, parameter estimation and benefit realization.\nBuilds on: experience with 30+ cascades that we not always that rationally designed, recreational game design"

The vision is that the Lindow-group at that point will be able to play a key role in consortia that can quickly develop very specialized oligonucleotide drugs for rare diseases or diseases in areas that commercial pharma companies do not pursue."
