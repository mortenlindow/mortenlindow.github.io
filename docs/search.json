    "text": "Figure: Morten’s little leadership model, (adapted from professional agile coach certification). The middle holds core principles that I strive towards to uphold in an organisation. The outer circle has the four roles that we need to consciously shift between, the top quadrants being one-to-many situations vs one-to-one on the bottom. Right is content neutral, while left is where you lead also a content expert. The bottom are the areas to which I can apply the roles. I try to remain conscious about when I apply each role. Trainer/teacher The trainer role is applied when I need to convey learning of content that I master to groups of people that do not yet\nWhenever possible, I use a very interactive and involving type of training, which often surprises people in highly scientific parts of pharma, where the prevalent culture tends to be classical lecture or conference style. I am inspired by the very practical ideas of Bowman, Training from the BACK of the room. When I remember Bowman’s 4Cs (connect, concepts, concrete practice and conclusion) and Six Trumps, my training sessions are usually much better.\nInternal training has almost always followed a strategy of raising overall organizational and scientific maturity in order to develop each other to have more T-shaped skill sets (generalizing specialists, e.g biology AND data science or biology AND project leadership). In many instances training was procured from external suppliers."

Apply to predict safety, activity and stability on public data sets.\n\nRequirement: Own students, postdocs for coding and data curation; collaboration on advanced machine learning\nBuilding on: Experience with hepatotox, acute neurotox and activity predictors, public datasets (from OpenOligoLake)\nExpansion: Base can be quickly and independently established, then expand through industry and tech collaborations (e.g. Roche, Novo, Silence, Abzu.ai)\n\n\n\nOpenOligoCommunity\nPre-Competitive Partnerships\nActivate and expand existing networks to build pre-competitive partnerships to enable and accelerate oligonucleotide drugs. Pursue national and EU funding.\n\nChallenge: Current Roche anchoring makes this more difficult\nSolution: Not-for-profit anchoring provides basis for catalyzing open sharing and diverse funding\nGoal: Facilitate public or joint ownership models or open source in precompetitive spaces\nRequirement: Outreach and ecosystem building, leading to joint grant applications\n\n\n\nOpenNABMPKPD\nMechanistic Systems Pharmacology Models\nMechanistic systems pharmacology models for nucleic acid based medicines.\nExpanding from ASO-model with PK and into other NABMs. Compartment-models for tissues, crossing barriers, entering cells, and molecular mode of action. Contrary to standard PKPD models used in drug development, this system of models would be more detailed and mechanistic including cellular uptake, stability of both pharmacophore and targeting system, molecular mechanisms of action (enzymes for oligos, transcription, translation etc for AAVs).\nBenefits: - Better understanding of what to optimize - Framework to become quantitative and more precise - Simulations used for teaching - Framework to simulate and plan wetlab experiments - Guidance for dosing schemes in animal and human studies\n\nRequirement: Own students, collaboration on math for dynamic models"

Additional funding necessary and expected.\n\n\nDesign-Build-Test-Learn Loops\nTo accelerate learning about oligonucleotide drugs it is essential to have fast learning loops between molecule design, synthesis, testing and learning. In this phase this should be established either through own lab footprint or through collaborations and vendors/CROs.\n\n\nOpenTranscriptomeFoundationModel\nFoundation Models for the Transcriptome\nGiven an oligonucleotide chemical structure, what are the predicted transcriptome changes? And given a desired transcriptome change (e.g. sick to healthy) what oligonucleotides will induce change? This is almost the holy grail of RNATherapy data science.\n\nRequirement: Development and connection to expertise on RNA-foundation models; connection to oligo perturbed transcriptome data sets (mined through OpenOligoLake or produced through collaboration)\nExpected evolution: RNASeq-methods (e.g DrugSeq or BRB-Seq) in early screening campaigns for oligonucleotides drugs\n\n\n\nOpenDiscoveryCascadeModel\nOptimization of Drug Discovery Cascades\nOne can define the drug discovery business process of lead identification and optimization as a series of operations that attempts to predict the in-human properties (e.g. efficacy, PK and safety) of sets of molecules. Each operation carries a cost in terms of time and money; an operation’s predictive validity is its ability to predict the outcome of a later, often more expensive, operation.\nThe Challenge: Discovery cascades are almost always designed by qualitative tradition, opinions and assumptions. Real discovery cascades are slow (2+ yrs) and involve many different specialists, meaning that holistic systems learning is very slow and difficult to implement.\nThe Vision: Create a stochastic graphical model abstraction of discovery cascades to enable: 1. More rational cascade design 2. Teaching tool—turn into a learning game with ‘engine building mechanics’ usable in university classes and pharma project/strategy teams\n\nRequirement: 2 students/post-docs; connection to graphical models expertise; game and workshop design expertise; industry connections for examples and parameter estimation\nBuilds on: Experience with 30+ cascades; recreational game design"

Read one of my pieces on the need for data science integration in pharma here.\nThis website is a slight adaptation of the job application that landed me this fantastic job. It is only sporadically updated. Please follow me on LinkedIn and the CPDSE website for news and updates.\nBriefly about Morten:\n\n17 yrs experience and track record of turning ideas into drug candidates. Leading and supporting roles in &gt;40 oligonucleotide drug discovery projects: 5 reached clinical stages, 2 in phase 2, 2 programs with novel conjugate targeting moeities reaching clinical development\nOne of the pioneers behind computational design of oligonucleotide drugs.
