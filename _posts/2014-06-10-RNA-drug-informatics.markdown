Lecture given in Albin Sandelins course on high throughput biology (University of Copenhagen). Here I talk about RNA directed drugs and how we apply bioinformatics and large data sets to facilitate drug discovery and development. 

First edition of this talk is from 2011, with a few updates in 2013 and 2014. All data has been published previously elsewhere.
