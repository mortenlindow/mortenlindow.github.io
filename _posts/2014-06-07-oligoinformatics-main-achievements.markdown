I was recently asked to summarize the main achievements of my oligoinformatics research. Very briefly. Here is an attempt :-)


# Oligoinformatics: leveraging the advantage of sequences to create predictive models in drug discovery

The main differentiator from small molecules and protein pharmaceuticals is that at [Santaris Pharma](www.santaris.com) both our targets (RNA) and compounds (oligonucleotides) can be meaningfully abstracted and represented as one-dimensional strings of characters (ATCG with optional modifications).  This allows leveraging of the most mature part the field of bioinformatics â€“ sequence analysis. To exploit this advantage Santaris has build a very strong bioinformatics unit and to ensure immediate operational value of our oligoinformatics research this unit is an integral part of all drug discovery projects.
The last three years our oligoinformatics innovations has increased the probability of effectively utilizing the Platform to find safe and potent oligonucleotides:

* Created a model capable of predicting hepatotoxic potential of LNA-oligonucleotides with 80% accuracy. This has now been in use for 15 months and have reduced the number of compounds lost due to hepatotoxicity in mice. Most viewed paper in Nucleic Acid Therapeutics in 2013.
* Delineated the relationship between affinity and potency and demonstrated that too high affinity can reduce potency of RNAse H recruiting oligonucleotides. Together with a computational model that predicts affinity from sequence alone, this allows Santaris to achieve an increased rate of highly potent oligonucleotides in our drug discovery screens. Published in Molecular Therapy Nucleic Acids together with academic collaborators from University of Copenhagen.
* We have showed that not just exons, but also introns of RNA transcripts are targetable by RNAse H recruiting oligonucleotides. This expands the target space by >10 fold, but also increase the possibilities of regulating unintended targets.
* We have thoroughly analyzed determinants for oligonucleotide specificity to arrive at algorithms and operational guidelines for maximizing specificity. 


The oligoinformatics group has a fruitful collaboration with academic partners, with whom Santaris is the recipient of a grant from the Danish Foundation for Strategic Research ([described on RNA.dk](rna.dk)). The grant has provided full financing for a senior scientist (Peter Hagedorn) for three years as well as a part time post doc (Lykke Pedersen). Without this grant and these fantastic minds the above achievements had not been possible.
