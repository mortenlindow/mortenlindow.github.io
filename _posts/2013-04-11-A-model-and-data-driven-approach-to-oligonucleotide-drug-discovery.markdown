# Abstract

A MODEL AND DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO OLIGONUCLEOTIDE DRUG DISCOVERY

The appeal of oligonucleotide antisense therapeutics is clearly its sequencebased nature: drug candidates can be designed on the back of an envelope using simple base pairing rules. In our opinion, this led to early day overconfidence that drugs can be discovered using too simplistic theoretical approaches. All oligonucleotides have been considered to have very similar (class like) properties, screening campaigns have used low numbers of compounds and specificity has been assayed only in silico and using simplistic string-based sequence matching. 

However, recent experience from us and others have uncovered a diversity in terms of properties of oligonucleotides: The tissue distribution differs widely from one oligo to another, some oligos induce liver toxicity at doses > 100 times lower than others, and oligos that are sequence-wise very similar to each other can have widely different potency. One solution to this apparent unpredictability is to adopt a small molecule approach to drug discovery and systematically explore ever larger portions of the space of all possible oligonucleotides. While this is certainly part of the solution, in this talk we demonstrate that the sequence-nature of oligonucleotides combined with data from a large number of screening campaigns may contain so much information that a systematic analysis can yield predictive models of affinity, potency, specificity, and toxicity. 

We wish to highlight results from three ongoing projects: 1) prediction of the hepatotoxic potential of LNA-modified oligonucleotides with an experimental accuracy above 75% (detailed on a poster by Hagedorn et al), 2) a kinetic model that predicts the experimental finding of an optimal affinity for enzyme recruiting gapmer oligonucleotides (detailed on a poster by Pedersen and Hagedorn et al) and 3) transcriptomics based experimental analysis of the sequence selectivity of a series of oligonucleotides administered to mice.
